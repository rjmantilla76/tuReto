## About

UVa Challenge is whatever you want it to be. But mainly it does the following:

  - Challenge users to do an UVa OJ problem you've already solved :triangular_flag_on_post:
  - Solve challenges issued by other users -- Now you are the victim :sob:
  - After 48 hours, all the victims that failed will appear on **THE SHAME WALL** :scream:

## Rules

Sounds amazing right? But with great power, comes great responsibility!<br>
That's why we got **RULES** you must follow to stay in the game:

 - You can only challenge users on your same level :level_slider:
 - You can only issue 3 daily challenges -- Victims also need to take a rest, except the shameful ones :sun_with_face:
 - You can never cry because we don't like crybabies :baby_bottle:
